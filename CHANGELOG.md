# Lucas's Awesome Messenger Extension, or short: LAME Messenger

## 4.2.0 (2025-01-01): New Year's Edition
### Improvements
- Populate Messenger's in-memory history from world's messages when user logs in or reloads the browser page (triggered by the `ready` hook)
- Add world-wide GM setting to exclude users as recipients
- When history is populated, whispers not received today will display their respective date along with the time

### Translation
- `whisper` messages are now called `Wisper` in German instead of the unwieldy `Fl√ºsternachricht`

### Documentation
- Add a link to the README to directly create a new `filter request` GitHub issue (in case you want to report a game system's private message that should be ignored by LAME Messenger)
